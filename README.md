# Pseudopotentials
Collection of pseudopotentials and SIESTA basis set for f-elements.

WARNING: The pseudopotentials and basis here should be used with care. Always test before usage!


PSML PPs for f-elements from pseudodojo input files in the github repo. The functional PBE and PBEsol are complete. 
For other elements, they can be found on the Pseudodojo website:
http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/

In the PPs directory, the subdirectories are named {XC}_{rel}, with XC={PBE, PBEsol},and rel={SR, FR}. 

SR: scalar-relativistic
FR: full-relativistic.



In the PPS_fincore directory are the pseudopotentials with f in the core.
