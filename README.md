# Pseudopotentials
Collection of pseudopotentials.

WARNING: The pseudopotentials here should be used with care. Always test before usage!


PSML PPs for f-elements from pseudodojo input files in the github repo. The functional PBE and PBEsol are complete. For the PW functional only La and Lu are included. 
For other elements, they can be found on the Pseudodojo website:
http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/

In the PPs directory, the subdirectories are named {XC}_{rel}, with XC={PBE, PBEsol, PW},and rel={SR, FR}. 

SR: scalar-relativistic
FR: full-relativistic.



In the PPS_fincore directory are the pseudopotentials with f in the core.
Currently there are some pps missing there:
